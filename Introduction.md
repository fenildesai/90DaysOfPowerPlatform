# Introduction to Power Platform

The Power Platform is a collection of low-code/no-code tools developed by Microsoft that allows users to build custom business applications and automate business processes. It is made up of three main components:

## Power Apps

Power Apps allows users to build custom business apps for web and mobile devices. It features a drag-and-drop interface and a large library of pre-built connectors and templates, making it easy for users to quickly create professional-grade apps without writing any code.

## Power Automate

Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow) is a tool for automating workflows and processes. It allows users to create "flows" that trigger actions based on certain events or conditions, such as creating a new record in a database or sending an email when a form is submitted.

## Power BI

Power BI is a business intelligence tool that allows users to create interactive data visualizations and dashboards. It integrates with a variety of data sources, including Excel spreadsheets and SQL databases, and features a drag-and-drop interface for creating charts and graphs.

## Getting Started with the Power Platform

To get started with the Power Platform, you will need a Microsoft account and a Power Platform license. There are several ways to obtain a license, including through an Office 365 subscription or as a standalone product.

Once you have a license, you can access the Power Platform through the [Microsoft Power Platform website](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/). Here, you will find documentation, tutorials, and resources to help you get started with each of the three components of the Power Platform.

You can also join the [Power Platform community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/) to connect with other users and experts, and participate in discussions and events.
